# Grade Tracker
 ## Describe the main concepts you applied.
   I used HTML and CSS to create a grid-based layout for a grade tracker. The main concepts I applied is CSS Grid for layout structure and basic styling. By defining a six-column grid structure with grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);, it ensured that each column could hold different data categories for modules, assignments, maximum marks, marks obtained, percentage, and grade.
 ## Discuss new skills or knowledge acquired.
   I learned how to use grid-template-columns to define a uniform structure and used CSS properties like text-align and border for content alignment and styling. I also gained insight into setting up a structured display for data-heavy content.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I realized how effective grids can be in making data easy to read and understand, especially in tabular or structured displays like this exercise. I also learned about accessibility considerations, such as ensuring clear and readable fonts and maintaining sufficient color contrast.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - A key challenge was ensuring that the layout remained balanced and readable across different screen sizes. Initially, the text alignment in each cell appeared inconsistent. I resolved this by using <text-align: center> for the .item class, which improved readability. 
   - Another challenge was managing white space and borders to create a clean, organized look, which I addressed by applying a border to each grid item and setting background-color to differentiate the items visually.

# Table
 ## Describe the main concepts you applied.
   This exercise is about creating a basic HTML table structure and styling it with inline CSS and an external stylesheet. The table displays information for students, including their first name, last name, student number, and grade. I applied CSS styling to customize the borders and header colors, making the table look more professional and organized.
 ## Discuss new skills or knowledge acquired.
   I gained a deeper understanding of HTML table structure, including how to use <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags to organize data effectively. I also learned how to control border styles with border-collapse and use inline styles for unique color customization of specific elements. 
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I learned how to create and style tables efficiently. I discovered the importance of border-collapse to achieve a cohesive look for table borders. I also learned about inline CSS and its role in quickly adjusting styles for specific elements, which was useful when applying custom colors to the header cells.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - One challenge I faced was achieving a clean and uniform border around each table cell. The borders appeared with gaps, making the table look uneven. I resolved this by using the border-collapse property, which removed the gaps and made the borders appear as single lines. 
   - I also encountered a small challenge in using inline styles for colors, but this was solved by applying RGB color values directly in the HTML for quick and specific color styling.
