# EXERCISE 1
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
   In this I build a simple, responsive webpage layout using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The main concepts applied included basic HTML structure, organizing content within <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> tags, and using Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout. I utilized Flexbox and Grid layouts provided by Tailwind to arrange navigation links, main content, and product sections in a visually appealing and accessible way.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
   Doing this exercise helped me strengthen my understanding of Tailwind CSS in areas like spacing, flex properties, and responsive classes (sm, md, lg). I learned how to use Tailwind to control transitions, hover effects, and shadows, which enhanced the interactivity of the page. I also became more comfortable with setting up a responsive grid layout, which allowed me to display products in a structured, organized format.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I realized how quickly I could implement responsive design with Tailwind’s then HTML-CSS, which saved time and kept my code cleaner. Additionally, I improved my understanding of the accessibility implications, especially regarding alt attributes for images, which are essential for creating accessible web content.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   A minor challenge I encountered was 
   - organizing and structuring the layout effectively, especially when balancing between Flexbox and Grid for  different sections. 
   - I initially had trouble aligning elements within the header and ensuring consistent spacing across different screen sizes. By referencing Tailwind's documentation and experimenting with different utility classes, I found effective solutions for alignment and spacing issues.
   - Another challenge was with responsive design: making sure the webpage looked good on both mobile and desktop views.

# PRACTICE EXERCISE 1
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
   I applied fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS styling, specifically focusing on creating a structured data table with Tailwind CSS. I structured the content using the <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, and <td> elements to define the table header, rows, and cells. Tailwind CSS classes were used to style the table, ensuring borders around cells, consistent spacing, and background coloring for the header row.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
   I gained experience with Tailwind CSS for table styling. I learned more about Tailwind’s approach to border collapse and layout options within tables, which are essential for cleanly presenting tabular data.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I learned more about using Tailwind CSS’s utility classes for rapid styling, realizing how efficient it is to adjust borders, spacing, and backgrounds for table elements. The experience highlighted how Tailwind’s utility-first approach helps keep the HTML clean and minimizes the need for external CSS files.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - One challenge was achieving consistent borders around each table cell, as Tailwind requires explicit border classes for each cell. I initially missed some borders, which led to a less uniform appearance. To resolve this, I made sure to apply border border-gray-300 to each cell (<td> and <th>) rather than relying on container-level styling.
   - Another minor challenge was balancing readability and styling within a small table layout. By adjusting padding and font size using Tailwind’s spacing utilities, I achieved a better balance between a clean design and readable content.

# PRACTICE EXERCISE 2
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
   In this project, I applied concepts of HTML structure, responsive grid layouts, and Tailwind CSS styling to build a photo gallery. I used a grid layout to organize images into responsive columns, which adapt to various screen sizes with Tailwind's responsive grid classes. Each image is enclosed in a bordered <div> to create a clear separation between photos, enhancing the visual organization.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
   Working on this project helped me become more proficient with Tailwind CSS grid layouts. I learned how to quickly set up columns that adjust automatically depending on screen size using classes like sm:grid-cols-2, md:grid-cols-3, and lg:grid-cols-4. I also became familiar with applying padding and borders around each image for a cleaner, structured look.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I learned the effectiveness of responsive design in displaying multiple elements in a gallery format. Using Tailwind's utility classes allowed me to create a grid that automatically adjusts based on device width, making the gallery accessible on both mobile and desktop. Additionally, I improved my understanding of using alt attributes to enhance accessibility for images.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   One challenge I faced was ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across all images. Initially, some images seemed uneven due to minor size discrepancies. I addressed this by setting a fixed width and height for each image to ensure a uniform appearance. Additionally, I adjusted the padding and margins to make the gallery look balanced on all screen sizes.
   Another challenge was managing file paths and alt text for the images. To avoid errors, I double-checked each image source (src) and alt attribute to ensure they were correctly linked and labeled.

# PRACTICE EXERCISE 3
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
   In this project, I focused on building a responsive navigation bar using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Key concepts included setting up a <nav> element with a flexible layout using Flexbox, creating spacing between navigation links, and applying hover effects as micro-interactions for an enhanced user experience. Tailwind CSS classes were used to manage layout, color, spacing, and hover effects for the links.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
   This project allowed me to gain a better understanding of how to use Tailwind CSS to add simple micro-interactions and improve the responsiveness of a navigation bar. I learned how Tailwind’s Flexbox utilities simplify aligning and spacing elements, making it easier to create a clean and structured navbar. Additionally, I explored hover states, applying hover:underline to the links to provide subtle feedback to users.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
   I learned how to effectively use Tailwind's utility classes to manage the layout and styling of navigation elements without writing custom CSS. Using responsive design techniques, I ensured that the navigation bar remains accessible and well-organized across different screen sizes. This experience highlighted the benefits of micro-interactions in creating a more engaging user experience with minimal additional code.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   One challenge I encountered was achieving the correct alignment and spacing between navigation items. Initially, the links were too close together, making the navbar look cluttered. I resolved this by adding Tailwind’s space-x-6 utility, which introduced even spacing between each list item.Another challenge was choosing colors that maintained readability and accessibility. After testing a few options, I selected a dark green background (bg-green-900) and white text (text-white) for strong contrast. This enhanced readability while maintaining an appealing, cohesive color scheme.
