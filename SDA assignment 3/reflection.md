# Website Replicate
 ## Describe the main concepts you applied.
  I structured the HTML using div containers and semantic tags like header, footer, and section, which helps in organizing content logically and improving accessibility.To arrange elements in a flexible layout, I used CSS Flexbox. I focused on establishing consistent padding, margins, and typography across sections to maintain a unified look and feel. 
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
  I learned that flexbox is useful for aligning items consistently across different containers and adapting them on smaller screens. I also learned the importance of alt attributes on images and consistent heading levels, which enhance accessibility. Through experimenting with font sizes and line-heights, I learned how typography impacts readability and overall design aesthetics.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
  One of the main takeaways was the value of consistent and organized styling. I saw how maintaining a structured CSS file and defining reusable styles like for buttons and heading simplifies the code and creates a cohesive design. 
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  I faced challenges ensuring that the layout worked on both large and small screens. The images and text containers would often overlap or resize inconsistently.
  Some challenges are styles conflicted, especially when trying to set universal padding or margin values. I solved this by organizing my CSS file more methodically, grouping styles for related components and using specific classes to target individual sections without affecting others.
