# Seminar Registration Form 
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
  I applied HTML concepts for structuring a user-friendly form, covering various input types like text, email, date, radio buttons, and dropdown selections. Each input element corresponds to specific fields that gather the user's information, such as name, date of birth, gender, email, password, phone number, seminar time, and meal preference. I also implemented the <label> element to enhance accessibility and link each label to its respective input field.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
  I gained experience using form elements, especially how to use different input types like radio, date, email, and select. These elements enabled me to create a comprehensive registration form tailored to gather essential details efficiently. Additionally, I learned about using the required attribute to ensure that users fill out each field, which adds basic validation to the form.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
  This exercise tought me how to organize form inputs logically and how each input type serves a different purpose in capturing user data. For instance, radio buttons allow single-option selection for gender, while dropdown menus (using <select> and <option> tags) are ideal for pre-defined choices like meal preference. Using labels effectively was also insightful as it improves usability, especially for accessibility and user experience.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  - One challenge I encountered was understanding how to associate labels with their corresponding inputs correctly. Initially, I missed setting the for attribute in <label> tags to match the id of input fields, which led to usability issues.I ensured each for attribute was correctly assigned, enhancing form navigation and accessibility. 
  - Another minor issue was with required fields, where some fields didn’t validate initially; reviewing the form helped identify and correct missing required attributes.

# College Event
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
  I utilized HTML and CSS concepts to create a list of events that can be easily navigated and visually distinguished. Each event section uses semantic HTML, with <h2> tags for section headers and <ul> tags to list event details like venue and time. In the CSS, I applied custom list styles and hover effects for each event type to differentiate them and add a more interactive feel.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
  I gained familiarity with setting different list styles and applying individual styling rules to various classes. Using CSS hover effects was also a new skill I learned. By assigning colors that change on hover, I enhanced the interactive aspect of each event list, making the page more engaging and visually dynamic.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
  I learned how to organize events in a clear and accessible way and how CSS selectors can target specific elements. I also learned how to use CSS classes effectively, with each event type having a unique color scheme that is applied on hover. This differentiation improved both the visual appeal and usability of the page.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  - One challenge I encountered was ensuring that each event list had a unique style without disrupting the page’s consistency. I overcame this by using specific class selectors for each event type and assigning unique colors for each hover effect. 
  - Another issue was aligning the event headers and lists aesthetically. To solve this, I applied styling directly to the headers and lists to make sure they looked unified and visually appealing.

# Hostel Room Maintenance Request Form
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
  I created an HTML form for students to submit maintenance requests for their hostel rooms, styled with CSS. I applied HTML form elements (<form>, <input>, <select>, and <button>) to capture user information. In CSS, I used classes to style labels, inputs, and the submit button, ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing layout.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
  I learned to implement form validation using the required attribute, which helps ensure users provide necessary details before submitting. Additionally, I practiced using class selectors and ID selectors in CSS for targeted styling, such as setting specific dimensions for the description box and customizing the appearance of the submit button with hover effects.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
  This practical helped me improve my understanding of how to structure and style forms for usability. I learned how to make forms visually organized by adding spacing, borders, and rounded corners. Customizing the urgency dropdown with a selection of urgency levels also helped me understand the importance of making options clear and easy to understand for users.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  - One challenge was ensuring that all input fields were properly aligned and visually consistent. To solve this, I used CSS border-radius, gap, and padding to achieve a uniform appearance.
  - Another issue was initially placing the submit button correctly. After some adjustments with margin and padding, I achieved a layout where the button fit naturally within the form structure.
