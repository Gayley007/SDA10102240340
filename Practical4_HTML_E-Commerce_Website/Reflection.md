# E-Commerce Website
 ## Describe thain concepts you applied.
  It involves creating a layout for an e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The HTML structure includes sections for navigation, a hero content area, and a products grid. I utilized CSS grid to organize product items in a visually appealing and responsive layout. For navigation, I created a flexbox-based navbar with links to different sections, a search bar, and a styled submit button.
 ## New skills or knowledge acquired.
  I practiced CSS properties like grid-template-columns to create a responsive grid for the product section. Using box-sizing: border-box, I could ensure consistent sizing across elements, simplifying the layout adjustments. Additionally, I used pseudo-classes such as :hover for interactive elements, improving the user experience.
 ## Discuss what you learned.
  Ilearned about CSS layout techniques, particularly in using flexbox for navigation and CSS grid for a responsive product gallery. I also learned to style form elements and buttons for user input fields, providing an organized and easy-to-use search bar within the header.
 ## Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  - Aligning the search bar and button within the navbar was initially challenging. To resolve this, I adjusted the width of the srch and bot elements and added padding and border-radius properties for a cohesive look.
  - Another challenge was managing consistent spacing between product items in the grid. I used gap in the grid container to provide uniform spacing, creating a cleaner, more organized display.
